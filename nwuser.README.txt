Various bits of public info:

This wraps _LOTS_ of file and directory functions to impliment 
per user settings inside of NWN. 

All "written" files get relocated from ~nwn/dir1/dir2/file to 
$HOME/.nwn/dir1/dir2/file

If a file exists in $HOME/.nwn/dir/file, then that file 
is used in preference to the real file in ~nwn. 

Theoretically you could burn a copy of a fresh NWN install to 
DVD, use this library, and play straight from DVD, however, I have
not verified this.  (If you do, please let me know one way or the other)

This too is very much a kludge. (IMHO)  With the actual source, I'm sure I could
do better, but as I'm not a Bioware employee, I find that highly unlikely.

Standard Legal Shtuff:

I do not guarentee this to work on any computer, except my own.   If it
should some how allow all the magic smoke to escape your computer, well
tough.  You were warned.   Avoid swimming for at least three hours after
using this product.

If someone would like to send me better installation instructions, I'll

Friendly bug reports will be examined as time permits.

----> enough disclaimers <----

Things required:
gcc, Perl, if building on x86_64, you will need 32bit development libraries. 

1) Unpack the tarball in your NWN directory.

2) execute ./nwuser_install.pl

3) modify your 'nwn' startup script to include the
following line:

export LD_PRELOAD=./nwuser.so

You will also need ./nwuser64 if on 64bits (x86_64) ex: 
export LD_PRELOAD=./nwuser.so:./nwuser64.so

   before executing nwmain

   If your using nwmovies, the line should look something like so: 

export LD_PRELOAD=./nwmovies.so:./nwnwuser.so

4) You may wish to do something similar for the 
   dmclient startup script.

5) Enjoy.. 

6) There is a bit of a log file in $HOME/.nwn/nwuser.log.   You may wish to modify
   your nwn startup script to remove it occasionally.

   It is only created if you turn on some debugging cruft I left in 
   the source code by setting NWU_VERBOSE. 

   The various logging levels correspond to:  (from code.h - See the code for more details. )

#define NWU_LOG_OPENDIR 0x01            /* opendir/readdir/closedir */
#define NWU_LOG_OPEN    0x02            /* open/fopen */
#define NWU_LOG_MKDIR   0x04            /* mkdir */
#define NWU_LOG_RMDIR   0x08            /* rmdir */
#define NWU_LOG_UNLINK  0x10            /* unlink */
#define NWU_LOG_STAT    0x20            /* xstat/lxstat */
#define NWU_LOG_CHDIR   0x40            /* chdir */
#define NWU_DEBUG_OPENDIR 0x80          /* debug out of opendir() replacement */
#define NWU_DEBUG_PATHING 0x100		/* debugging of pathing changes */

  So to log rmdirs, and open's, one would set NWU_VERBOSE=10
  (0x8 + 0x2)

----> Known Issues <-----

None known.

08/02/2004 START NOTES

Updates to call the initialization function, should one of NWUsers override
functions be called before complete initialization occurs.  This is known
to affect SuSE 9.1, and probably anything else that uses that SELinux stuff. 
(whatever it is.) 

08/02/2004 END NOTES 

09/07/2004 START NOTES

Nasty bug found WRT chapter changes, and the way NWN opens its databases
w/ absolute pathing.   (Thanks to Belegdol for finding it. - I think :)  ) 
Apparently nobody's using this code, as its been out for quite some time, 
and nboody's noticed this till now. <snicker> 

09/07/2004 END NOTES

10/04/2004 START NOTES

Sigh, the 09/07/2004 updates broke something that I've yet to see myself, nor
be able to track down.  This release is to let loose some debugging code
to hopefully track the problem down. 

See nwuser.DEBUG.txt for more details. 

10/04/2004 END NOTES

10/05/2004 START NOTES 

With the help of 'alanswanson' from the forum's I've tracked down a logic
error inside of NWUser that would cause a crash during NWN startup. 
This code contains the fix. 

10/05/2004 END NOTES

05/24/2006 START NOTES

Added more debugging stuff 

05/24/2006 END NOTES

01/23/2008 START NOTES

This code also has debugging to log the various reads/writes if
you're attempting ot modify the code for other purposes. 

Verified against 1.67&1.69b2, and updated for x86_64. 

My thanks to Erydan and Skildron for their help
getting this to work on x86_64.

On x86_64, you will get various errors out of ld.so
stating things like: 

ERROR: ld.so: object './nwmovies.so' from LD_PRELOAD cannot be preloaded: ignored.

It has to do w/ ld.so only has one LD_PRELOAD variable for both 32bit, 
and 64bit if your running a 64bit binary, you can't use a 32bit preload, and 
vice versa.   Ignore them.
